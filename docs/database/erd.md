3. Design Notes
Unique constraints: profiles.user_id, facilities.name, and (team_tournament.team_id, team_tournament.tournament_id) so a team joins a tournament only once.

Cascade rules: deleting a user cascades to their profile, teams, and bookings. Deleting a venue is restricted while fields still exist.
